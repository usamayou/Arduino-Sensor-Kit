# Arduino-Sensor-Kit
I will be explaining the basics about all the individual sensors in the "37 In 1 Sensors Kit For Arduino".
Every Step will contain a tiny bit of information about one sensor and a basic code will be provided.
Most of the codes use a LED on pin 13.

The kit contains:

JoyStick
Flame Sensor
RGB LED
Heartbeat Sensor
Light Cup
Hall Magnetic Sensor
Relay
Linear Hall Sensor
SMD RGB
7 Color Flash
Tilt Switch
Temperature Sensor
Big Sound Sensor
Touch Sensor
Two-Color LED
Laser Emitter
Ball Switch
Analog Temperature Sensor
Small Sound Sensor
Digital Temperature Sensor
Two-Color LED (small)
Button
Photoresistor
IR Emission
Tracking Sensor
Buzzer
Reed Switch
Shock Sensor
Temperature And Humidity Sensor
IR Receiver
Avoidance Sensor
Passive Buzzer
Mini Reed
Rotary Encoders
Analog Hall Sensor
Tap Module
Light Blocking
Please note that none of the provided codes are mine. I tested them all and they work fine.
